Submit 							Button 												Inactive until all fields are filled and pass validation 
																					
Clicking submit shows the user the completed details and asks to check and confirm, before a final submission.

Validation/Constraints:

-Regex validate constraints on inputs.

-Responsive validation 
Input boxes should highlight and explain errors as the user makes them.
eg. if user tries to put a letter in BSBNumber, highlight box red & show red text underneath "BSB must include only numbers".

-Submit button is non-responsive unless all validation constraints are fulfilled. All fields mandatory.

-In choosing constraints...
Minimal constraints are chosen, with over-estimated length. It is difficult to guess every possible valid input, and no constraints can ensure 100% correct input. 
Constraints are chosen to guide the user, give writers of processing functions an idea of what data type to expect from the submitted form, and limit garbage data.
However, all the constraints in the world can't prevent a user from mis-typing their name or number.


Workflow:
1. HR sends link to new staff member 
(this could be a temporary link, or require a temporary login, to protect the form from unauthorised access)

2. New user fills, confirms and submits form.

3. In administraion portal, HR finds the completed form.
HR is able to check the submitted data.

4. Completed form has entry for 'Base Salary' and button to calculate and fill Tax and Super payment details.
